Here are some rough notes that might help you create a pidgin-otr Win32 build on
a Linux system with mingw32. These have been tested on Ubuntu 11.04.

I am listing packages and their build instructions in the order they should be
built. Good luck!

libgpg-error-1.0:
  (before configure)
  HOST_CC=gcc
  DLLTOOL=i586-mingw32msvc-dlltool 
  AS=i586-mingw32msvc-as
  export HOST_CC DLLTOOL AS
  ./configure --with-pic --build=`./config.guess` --host=i586-mingw32msvc --prefix=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc 
  make
  sudo make install

gcrypt-1.2.1:
  w32root=i586-mingw32msvc ./autogen.sh --build-w32
  Then append #undef HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY  to libgcrypt config.h
  Apply windows slow random fix (patch on otr website, listed as "Note that if you're compiling from source on win32...")
  make
  sudo make install
  
libotr:
  ./configure --with-pic --build=`./config.guess` --host=i586-mingw32msvc --prefix=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc --with-libgcrypt-prefix=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc
  make
  sudo make install

pidgin-otr:
  You will need: Pidgin source code distributable, Pidgin Win32 distributable, and an "all-in-one bundle" of the GTK+ stack 2.14.7 or greater (e.g., gtk+-bundle_2.24.10-20120208_win32.zip).
  In Makefile.mingw, specify the location of PIDGIN_HEADERS, PURPLE_HEADERS, GTK_WIN32_BUNDLE, and PIDGIN_WIN32_LIBS
  Ensure either pkg-config will correctly resolve all the dependencies for glib-2.0 and gtk+-2.0 (there is a README in the GTK+ bundle about this), or uncomment (and perhaps revise) the hardcoded list of includes for GTK_HDRS
  make -f Makefile.mingw

nsis:
  sudo apt-get install nsis
  Locate the "nsisunz" plugin (a google search for "nsisunz.zip" should be sufficient)
  Extract the DLL to /usr/local/share/nsis/Plugins (yes it's a DLL extension, but it will still work for GNU/Linux nsis)
  make -f Makefile.mingw installer     <-- This should now build the nsis installer
