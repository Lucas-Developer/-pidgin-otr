	* otr-plugin.h:
	* otr-plugin.c (otrg_plugin_proto_supports_otr): New function to
	check whether a given protocol supports OTR.  Right now,
	everything except IRC is assumed to support it.

	* otr-plugin.c (supply_extended_menu): Don't add the "OTR
	Settings" menu option to the per-buddy menu if this buddy's
	protocol doesn't support OTR.

	* ui.c (otrg_ui_find_policy): If the protocol doesn't support
	OTR, always return a policy of OTRL_POLICY_NEVER.

	* README:
	* packaging/fedora/gaim-otr.spec:
	* packaging/windows/gaim-otr.nsi:
	* configure.ac: Change version to 2.0.2

	* packaging/debian: Remove this directory, as Thibaut VARENE
	<varenet@debian.org> is now responsible for the debian packages.

	* otr-plugin.c (process_receiving_im): If libotr tells us to
	ignore this received message (because it's an internal protocol
	message), it's not enough just to return 1 from this function,
	since other plugins that catch receiving-im-msg may later return
	0, and gaim only checks the return value from the last such
	plugin.  So we additionally set the message to NULL.

	* gtk-ui.c (otrg_gtk_ui_config_buddy):
	* otr-plugin.c (supply_extended_menu): For consistency, use "OTR
	Settings" instead of "OTR Options" everywhere.

2005-03-08

	* gtk-dialog.c (otrg_gtk_dialog_private_key_wait_start): Move a
	variable declaration to the right place.
