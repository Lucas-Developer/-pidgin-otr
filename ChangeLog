2005-12-18

	* gtk-dialog.c:
	* otr-plugin.c: Compile against either gaim-1.x or gaim-2.x,
	based on a patch from Dustin Howett <alaricx@gmail.com>.

2005-11-02

	* INSTALL: Add instruction for doing autoreconf from CVS
	version, if your libotr.m4 is in a nonstandard place.

	* Makefile.mingw:
	* README:
	* configure.ac: Release version 3.0.0

	* README: Update UI instructions for version 3.0.0

2005-10-27

	* gtk-dialog.c: Better icons

	* gtk-dialog.c: Make the text of dialog boxes selectable

2005-10-19

	* dialogs.h:
	* dialogs.c:
	* gtk-dialog.c:
	* otr-plugin.c: Track libotr API change: protocol_version is now
	part of the ConnContext, and not passed separately to the
	gone_secure() and still_secure() plugins.

	* otr-plugin.c: Removed automatic sending of
	OTRL_TLV_DISCONNECTED at quitting time, since it causes
	unreadable messages to be sent to people with clients who don't
	send those messages.

	* packaging/fedora/gaim-otr.spec: Patches from Paul

2005-10-16

	* Conform to the new libotr API.

2005-08-04

	* otr-plugin.c: Disconnect all contexts when gaim is about to
	quit.

2005-07-29

	* otr-plugin.c (confirm_fingerprint_cb): Match the changing
	libotr API.

2005-06-24

	* README:
	* Makefile.mingw:
	* packaging/fedora/gaim-otr.spec:
	* packaging/windows/gaim-otr.nsi:
	* configure.ac: Change version to 3.0.0 (but don't yet release)

	* Makefile.mingw: add -lgtk_pixbuf-2.0-0 for the OTR button
	pixmaps.

	* configure.ac: Require libotr 3.x.

	* dialogs.h:
	* dialogs.c (otrg_dialog_unknown_fingerprint): This function now
	merely informs the user that a new fingerprint has been
	received, and doesn't require the user to confirm it before it
	can be used.

	* dialogs.h:
	* dialogs.c (otrg_dialog_verify_fingerprint): New function to
	allow the user to confirm the authenticity of a fingerprint.

	* dialogs.h: Add #defines for the online help URLs.

	* gtk-dialog.c: There are now three states a conversation can be
	in: Not Private (not using OTR), Unverified (using OTR, but to a
	fingerprint that hasn't been verified, so you are subject to a
	straightforward active attack), and Private (using OTR with a
	verified fingerprint).  There are new icons for these states
	that appear in the OTR button.

	* gtk-dialog.c: Callers of create_dialog can now specify
	additional widgets to appear in the dialog boxes.  We use this
	primarily for the "What's this?" help widgets.

	* gtk-dialog.c (otrg_gtk_dialog_unknown_fingerprint): This
	function no longer has to deal with callbacks to get the user's
	response to the new fingerprint.

	* gtk-dialog.c: Right-clicking the OTR button now produces an
	OTR menu, with options to start or end the private conversation,
	verify the fingerprint, view the secure session id, or get help.

	* gtk-dialog.c (dialog_update_label_conv): Have the OTR button
	obey the user's requested style (text only, pictures only,
	pictures and text, none).  Note that if the user chooses "none",
	there's currently no way to reach the aforementioned menu.

	* gtk-dialog.c: The "private connection established", "private
	connection refreshed", and "private connection ended" messages
	no longer pop up dialog boxes.  Instead, they appear inline in
	the conversation window.  The session id and fingerprint which
	used to appear in the "private connection established" dialog
	are now viewable via the OTR button right-click menu.

	* gtk-dialog.c: New dialog to view and verify fingerprints.

	* gtk-dialog.c: New dialog to view secure session id.

	* gtk-ui.c: New "Verify fingerprint" button in the plugin UI,
	and rearrangement of the (now four) buttons into a 2x2 table.

	* gtk-ui.c: New "Verified" column in the Known Fingerprints
	table.

	* otr-plugin.c (confirm_fingerprint_cb): This function no longer
	has to deal with callbacks due to the change in the libotr API.

	* otr-plugin.h:
	* otr-plugin.c (otrg_plugin_write_fingerprints): Refactored this
	function so that other parts of the code can call it.

	* otr-plugin.h:
	* otr-plugin.c (otrg_plugin_conv_to_context)
	(otrg_plugin_context_to_conv, otrg_plugin_context_to_trust): New
	functions.

2005-05-27

	* otr-plugin.c:
	* gtk-dialog.c: Replace the OTR button in the button box if the
	user changes the button style (which causes gaim to remove all
	the buttons, and only replace its own).

	* gtk-dialog.c: Add a right-button context menu to the OTR
	button.  Currently, it only has one entry, which has the same
	effect as clicking the button; eventually, you'll be able to do
	other things here, like getting the info currently in the
	"Private Connection Established" dialog.  This also opens the
	door to making the button functionality available if the user
	hides his buttons completely (if we can find a place to make
	this context menu appear; say, on some F-key?).

	* otr-plugin.c (notify_cb): Initialize gaimlevel so that -Wall
	stops complaining, even though there's no situation in which it
	can actually get used while unset.

2005-05-19

	* otr-plugin.h:
	* otr-plugin.c (otrg_plugin_proto_supports_otr): New function to
	check whether a given protocol supports OTR.  Right now,
	everything except IRC is assumed to support it.

	* otr-plugin.c (supply_extended_menu): Don't add the "OTR
	Settings" menu option to the per-buddy menu if this buddy's
	protocol doesn't support OTR.

	* ui.c (otrg_ui_find_policy): If the protocol doesn't support
	OTR, always return a policy of OTRL_POLICY_NEVER.

2005-05-03

	* README:
	* packaging/fedora/gaim-otr.spec:
	* packaging/windows/gaim-otr.nsi:
	* configure.ac: Change version to 2.0.2

	* packaging/debian: Remove this directory, as Thibaut VARENE
	<varenet@debian.org> is now responsible for the debian packages.

2005-03-23

	* otr-plugin.c (process_receiving_im): If libotr tells us to
	ignore this received message (because it's an internal protocol
	message), it's not enough just to return 1 from this function,
	since other plugins that catch receiving-im-msg may later return
	0, and gaim only checks the return value from the last such
	plugin.  So we additionally set the message to NULL.

2005-03-21

	* gtk-ui.c (otrg_gtk_ui_config_buddy):
	* otr-plugin.c (supply_extended_menu): For consistency, use "OTR
	Settings" instead of "OTR Options" everywhere.

2005-03-08

	* gtk-dialog.c (otrg_gtk_dialog_private_key_wait_start): Move a
	variable declaration to the right place.

2005-03-01

	Initial autoconfiscation, thanks to Greg Troxel <gdt@ir.bbn.com>.
