REQUIREMENTS

To compile the OTR plugin for pidgin, you'll need at least:
 - libgpg-error 1.0  [ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error/]
 - libgcrypt 1.2.0   [ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/]
 - libotr 4.0.0      [https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/]
 - glib 2.6          [http://www.gtk.org/download/]
 - gtk+ 2.6          [http://www.gtk.org/download/]
 - pidgin 2.x        [http://pidgin.im/]

You'll also need the usual autotools, such as automake-1.9, autoreconf,
libtool, intltool, etc.

If you install these with a package manager, you'll probably need the
-dev or -devel versions of the packages.

COMPILING (non-Win32)

If you're got a CVS copy, you will need to regenerate the configure
script using:

    intltoolize --force --copy
    autoreconf -s -i

[If you installed libotr.m4 somewhere that autoreconf can't find it,
you can try putting "ACLOCAL_FLAGS= -I /path/to/share/aclocal" at the
top of Makefile.am.]

Once you have the configure script (which comes with the source
deistribution), run it with any options that may be necessary for your
system.  Some examples:

Linux:
    ./configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man

NETBSD:
    CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/pkg/include" LDFLAGS="-R/usr/pkg/lib -L/usr/pkg/lib" \
	./configure --prefix=/usr/pkg

Once the configure script writes a Makefile, you should be able to just
run "make".

If you want a plugin that has libgcrypt linked statically, use
"make -f Makefile.static".  Makefile.static assumes libotr.a and libgcrypt.a
are available in /usr/lib.  If they're somewhere else, use something like
"LIBOTRDIR=/usr/local/lib make -f Makefile.static".

COMPILING (Win32)

Use the provided Makefile.mingw:

    make -f Makefile.mingw

See INSTALL.mingw for a script to try to do everything for you,
including all of the dependencies.

INSTALLATION

You should be able to simply do "make install".  If you want to install
somewhere other than / (this is useful for package creators), use
something like "make DESTDIR=/path/to/install/to install".
