		Off-the-Record Messaging plugin for GAIM
			  v3.0.0,  2 Nov 2005

This is a gaim plugin which implements Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging.
It is known to work (at least) under the Linux and Windows versions of
gaim (1.x).

OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:
 - Encryption
   - No one else can read your instant messages.
 - Authentication
   - You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
 - Deniability
   - The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
     checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a
     conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However,
     _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
     he sees are authentic and unmodified.
 - Perfect forward secrecy
   - If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation
     is compromised.

USAGE

Run gaim, and open the Preferences panel.  (If you had a copy of gaim
running before you installed gaim-otr, you will need to restart it.)
Choose "Plugins".  Find the Off-the-Record Messaging plugin, and enable
it by selecting the "Load" box next to it.  This will cause
"Off-the-Record Messaging" to appear under "Plugins" in the list at the
left.  Click "Off-the-Record Messaging" to bring up the OTR UI.  The UI
has two "pages": "Known fingerprints" and "Config".

The "Config" page allows you generate private keys, and to set OTR
options.

    Private keys are used to authenticate you to your buddies.  Choose
    one of your accounts from the menu, click "Generate" and wait until
    it's finished.  You'll see a sequence of letters and number appear
    above the "Generate" button.  This is the "fingerprint" for that
    account; it is unique to that account.  If you have multiple IM
    accounts, you can generate private keys for each one separately.
    Note that if you don't generate keys in this way, they will be
    generated automatically, when they are needed.

    The OTR options determine when private messaging is enabled.  The
    checkboxes on this page control the default settings; you can edit
    the per-buddy settings by right-clicking on your buddy in the buddy
    list, and choosing "OTR Options" from the menu.

    The options are:
    [X] Enable private messaging
      [X] Automatically initiate private messaging
        [ ] Require private messaging

    If the "enable private messaging" box is unchecked, private messages
    will be disabled completely (and the other two boxes will be greyed
    out, as they're irrelevant).

    If the first box is checked, but "automatically initiate private
    messaging" is unchecked, private messaging will be enabled, but only
    if either you or your buddy explicitly requests to start a private
    conversation (and the third box will be greyed out, as it's
    irrelevant).

    If the first two boxes are checked, but "require private messaging"
    is unchecked, OTR will attempt to detect whether your buddy can
    understand OTR private messages, and if so, automatically start a
    private conversation.

    If all three boxes are checked, messages will not be sent to your
    buddy unless you are in a private conversation.

The "Known fingerprints" page allows you to see the fingerprints of any
buddies you have previously communicated with privately.

You can close the Preferences panel (but make sure not to disable
(un-"Load") the OTR plugin).

IM as normal with your buddies.  If you want to start a private
conversation with one of them, click the "OTR: Not Private" button in
the conversation window.

If your buddy does not have the OTR plugin, a private conversation will
(of course) not be started.  [But he'll get some information about OTR
instead.]

If your buddy does have the OTR plugin (and it's enabled), a private
conversation will be initiated.

If both you and your buddy have OTR software, and your OTR options set
to automatically initiate private messaging, your clients may recognize
each other and automatically start a private conversation.

The first time you have a private conversation with one of your buddies,
his fingerprint will appear.  It's usually a good idea to make sure it's
correct, perhaps via the phone, or some other authenticated
communication.

If it's wrong, it means someone's intercepting your communication.
While unlikely, this is one of the things this plugin detects.

Once you've seen your buddy's fingerprint, it will be stored, and
future private conversations with him won't bother you with this dialog.
[Unless, of course, he uses a different fingerprint, perhaps from a
different IM account, or on a different computer.  It's OK to have
multiple fingerprints for the same IM account, on different machines.]

At this point, the label on the OTR button in the conversation window
will change to "OTR: Unverified".  This means that, although you are
sending encrypted messages, you have not yet verified your buddy's
fingerprint, and so it is not certain that the person who can decrypt
these messages is actually your buddy (it may be an attacker).

If you right-click on the OTR button, you will get a menu with the
following options:

Start / Refresh private conversation

    Choosing this menu option is the same as clicking the OTR button: it
    will attempt to start (or refresh, if you're already in one) a
    private conversation with this buddy.

End private conversation

    If you wish to end the private conversation, and go back to
    communicating without privacy protection, you can select this
    option.  Note that if you have "Automatically initiate private
    messaging" set, it is likely that a new private conversation will
    automatically begin immediately.

Verify fingerprint

    Choose this menu option once you have your buddy on the phone, or
    some other authenticated communication channel (such as a gpg-signed
    message).  Have your buddy read you his fingerprint.  If it matches
    what is displayed in the dialog box, pull down the selection that
    says "I have not" (verified that this is in fact the correct
    fingerprint), and change it to "I have".

    Once you do this, the label on the OTR button will change to "OTR:
    Private".  Note that you only need to do this once per buddy (or
    once per fingerprint, if your buddy has more than one fingerprint).
    gaim-otr will remember which fingerprints you have marked as
    verified.

View secure session id

    The "secure session id" is another way to verify that you're actually
    chatting with your buddy, and not some eavesdropper
    ("man-in-the-middle" is the technical term).  Phone him up, and ask
    him to read his bold part, and read yours back to him.  If they're
    both correct, you're assured that there's no one intercepting your
    private conversation.  This is secure, even if you know that one or
    both of your private keys have been compromised.

    You should almost never need to use this; it is only useful in the
    event that you know your private keys have been compromised, and you
    wish to have a private conversation anyway.

What's this?

    This will open a web browser to get online help.


If you open the Preferences panel back up, and go to the OTR UI, you'll
see your buddy, and his fingerprint, listed there.  The "Status" should
currently be "Private", which means you're having a private
conversation.  Other possibilities are "Unverified", which means you
have not yet verified your buddy's fingerprint, "Not private", which
means you're just chatting in IM the usual (non-OTR) way, and
"Finished", which means your buddy has selected "End private
conversation"; at this point, you will be unable to send messages to him
at all, until you either also choose "End private conversation" (in
which case further messages will be sent unencrypted), or else choose
"Refresh private conversation" (in which case further messages will be
sent privately).

By selecting one of your buddies from the list, you'll be able to do one
or more of the following things by clicking the buttons below the list:
 - "Start private conversation": if the status is "Not private" or
   "Finished", this will attempt to start a private conversation.
 - "End private conversation": if the status is "Unverified", "Private",
   or "Finished", you can force an end to your private conversation by
   clicking this button.  There's not usually a good reason to do this,
   though.
 - "Verify fingerprint": this will open the fingerprint verification
   dialog discussed above.
 - "Forget fingerprint": this will remove your buddy's fingerprint from
   the list.  You'll have to re-verify it the next time you start a
   private conversation with him.  Note that you can't forget a
   fingerprint that's currently in use in a private conversation.
